This folder contains the older iterations of the code that led to the final version in the 'PaperAnalysis' directory. All iteration notes are saved in the top portion of each .py file. The scripts listed here belong to four categories:  
- 'Tail' scripts analyze the cleaned spectra obtained from lines of sight down the tail of the magnetosphere,  
- 'Flank' scripts analyze the cleaned spectra obtained from lines of sight through the flank of the magnetosphere, and
- 'Hot' scripts analyze the cleaned spectra from the indicated type of line of sight, but with a second absorbed thermal component for the Galactic Halo.
- If 'Hot' is not in the script name, then the script analyzes the cleaned spectra from the indicated type of line of sight with the default spectral analysis, namely excluding the second absorbed thermal component for the Galactic Halo.  

Other files include the rmfs used, the XSPEC scripts to sum the composite spectra, the input files for the heliospheric SWCX calculations per observation and the Hydrogen column absorptions, and a few exploratory scripts.
