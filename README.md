# MagnetosphericSWCX
Code used to produce the results in a publication on separating out the magnetospheric SWCX X-ray spectral contribution in astrophysical observations of dark fields. The final codes used to produce the publication results are in the PaperAnalysisCode directory, while most of the code iterations along the way are included in the OlderVersions directory. These codes include PyXSPEC code (.py files), XSPEC scripts (.xcm files) and other input files (e.g. the predicted heliospheric SWCX line intensities and the arf/rmfs used). 
If you have questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to create an issue to get my attention. 

For historical purposes, the codes used to perform the analysis of the heliospheric SWCX published in Ringuette et al. (2021) are also included in the 'HSWCXPaperCode' and 'HSWCXOlderCode' directories, which have similar code types.
