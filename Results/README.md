This directory contains the excel spreadsheets produced by the pyXSPEC analysis scripts and included in the paper. File names with 'Flank' were produced in the analysis of the observations with lines of sight through the flanks of the Earth's magnetosheath. Similarly, file names with 'Tail' were produced using data obtained from observations with lines of sight down the tail of the magnetosheath. File names with 'Hot' indicate results using two absorbed temperature components. File names without 'hot' indicate results using one absorbed temperature component.

Parameters that were fit in the spectral analysis are followed by the columns 'ErrL' and 'ErrU' indicating the lower and upper 90% confidence intervals for the fitted parameter. Parameters that were held constant or are otherwise descriptive (e.g. RA) are found towards the beginning/left of the spreadsheet. Columns without a heading were used to format the results. The columns after the 'red_X^2' column calculate the emission measure of the absorbed temperature component(s). Highlighting in general indicates a significant detection of something, such as significant detection of the higher temperature component for fields HS0070 and HS0073 (MSWCX3 and MSWCX6) in the MSWCXTailsHot spreadsheet and significant detection of the O VII line in the MSWCXFlanks spreadsheet.
