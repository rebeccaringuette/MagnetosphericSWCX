This directory contains a few example data files. The 006801_01_cl1_14.pi file is an example of a spectrum file before summing and rebinning. The 0068 indicates the ID number, \_01_ indicates the observation chunk number, and d14 indicates the detector number. For example, the second file of the same naming pattern is for ID number 0075, observation 7 and detector 38. An example summed file is also given, also named with the ID number and the detector number, but now named by the observation name (e.g. flank06). The example rebinned file is indicated by 'rebin40' added to the end of the filename.
